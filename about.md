I am Anne Celestino or otherwise known Hubwub, to some people. I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Illinois at Chicago. One thing is for certain, I dream of being a mango farmer. Interests range from being on Reddit, K-pop, Korean TV shows, #ESPORTS (ALL CAPS) and soccer/football.
